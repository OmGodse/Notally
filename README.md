### Background
Although there are many notes apps out there, they're all hideous, glitchy, low quality or all 3 at the same time.

Maybe the developer views developing a beautiful user interface as the realm of _lowly_ designers. Maybe he just doesn't care.

Well, Notally is none of these things. It's extremely light, minimalistic and elegant. There are minimal dependencies and lines of code. (All without compromising on readability)
